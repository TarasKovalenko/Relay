## Security Best Practices for Implementation

When implementing CentralConfigGenerator in your applications, consider these security best practices:

1. **Keep the library updated** to the latest supported version.
2. **Limit access to configuration files** - ensure configurations with sensitive data have appropriate access controls.
3. **Use encrypted configuration** for sensitive values like API keys, tokens, and credentials.
4. **Implement the principle of least privilege** when defining access to configuration data.
5. **Validate all configuration inputs** - never trust input directly without validation.
6. **Enable logging and monitoring** for configuration access and changes.
7. **Audit configuration usage** regularly to ensure compliance with security policies.

## Security-related Configuration

CentralConfigGenerator provides several security features:

- **Encryption**: Support for encrypting sensitive configuration values
- **Access Control**: Granular access control for configuration settings
- **Validation**: Input validation for configuration values
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of configuration access and modifications
